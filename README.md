Lightcode is a VSCode extension to debug iOS apps on iPhone - a lightweight alternative to Xcode.

Features:
- **Run**: build the app, install to iPhone, launch the app to start debugging.
- **Attach**: with the app already installed, launch the app to start debugging right away.
- Breakpoints, view callstacks, inspect variables with `po`, etc.
